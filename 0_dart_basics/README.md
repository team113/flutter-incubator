Step 0: Become familiar with Dart basics
========================================

**Estimated time**: 1 day

Read and firmly study the [Dart Overview], provided by the [Dart] team. Learn about the language basics (syntax, types, functions, classes, asynchronous programming).

Be sure to check out the [Effective Dart] guidelines for writing consistent [Dart] code.

Investigate the [Core Libraries] available in [Dart], and learn how to enable [Dart Packages] and dependencies to use in your [Dart] project. You may explore the [pub.dev] for community made packages.

To practice the theory you may pass the [Dart Cheatsheet].




## Questions

After completing the steps above, you should be able to answer (and understand why) the following questions:
- What runtime [Dart] has? Does it use a GC (garbage collector)?
- What is [Dart] VM? How [Dart] works natively and in a browser, and why?
- What is JIT and AOT compilation? Which one [Dart] supports?
- What statically typing means? What is a benefit of using it?
- What memory model [Dart] has? Is it single-threaded or multiple-threaded?
- Does [Dart] has asynchronous programming? Parallel programming?
- Is [Dart] OOP language? Does it have an inheritance?

Once you're done, notify your mentor/lead in the appropriate [PR (pull request)][PR] (checkmark this step in [README](../README.md)), and he will examine what you have learned.
